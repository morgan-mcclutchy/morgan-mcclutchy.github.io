			<p>There has been a long standing misconception that healthy food is expensive. While this may be true in certain cases, for the most part this claim is false. 
			The key is paying attention to weekly sales and knowing when items are a good price. When these factors are taken into account, healthy eating can be just as 
			cost effective as pre made and packaged foods.See <a href"second.html"></a> for more information.

		<p>Another stigma (that is unfortunately true) is that food access directly impacts health and diet quality. Specifically, research by Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Shuval,
		researchers at _____, have found that families on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) have an increased consumption of added sugar, empty calories and 
		saturated fats. Additionally, there is in increased rick of developing Type 2 Diabeties and becoming obese (to read more about this study click

		a resource for those who want to try to make an important change in their lifestyle. </p>
