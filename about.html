<h4>About the Creator</h4>

</p>Morgan McClutchy is a senior at Farmington High School in Farmington, Connecticut. For her Custom Capstone Project, she elected to create a website
to focus on bridging the gap between food access and nutrition. To push her thinking, she decided to learn to code to build her own website. Her
teachers, Mr. Daddio, Mr. Barron, and Mrs. Johnson, have all been a tremendous help along the way.
